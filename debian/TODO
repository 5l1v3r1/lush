* clarify on what python version it really depends since
   packages/python/python-config.lsh lists 2.2

* clarify if copying of autotools files during clean is a good thing,
   but it was added by dh_make

* rename lush-library into lush-common

* take care about proper handling of material under etc/ - I better might
   prebuild all modules and install them systemwide.

Taken care of
-------------
* emacs mode installation

* proper depends and -dev depends for lush itself since it will
   compile 'on-fly' later on

* Fix rules since it seems to be quite messy in binary-* rules...

* verify that 243501 is non existant - try to build on debian provided
   ia64 box -- it builds fine on itanix within up-to-date sid
   chroot.
 Did build nicely...

* figure out that why it wasn't even attempted to built for ia64 -- so
   where I have to remove that ban
